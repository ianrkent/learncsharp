        <aside class="notes">
            <p>Q: Ask them why all cooks are male?</p>
            <p>A: Because a thread cannot do more than 1 thing at a time</p>
            <p>A Thread can context switch though, extremely quickly, to make it look like it is doing lots of things
                at the same time - but it does still have overhead (bringing in the Thread Context)</p>

        Can anyone <strong>actually</strong> multi-task?

            <p>Give each girl a coloured sticky note, andboys a different colour (not pink and blue!! - get a girl to
                choose)</p>
            <p>Get into pairs, each with a timer (on their phone), draw 3 horizontal lines on a page, creating 4 rows</p>
            <p><strong>Round 1: </strong>time each other writing "Switch Tasking Is A Thief" on the top line,followed
                by the numbers 1 - 21 on the second line. Write down your time</p>
            <p><strong>Round 2: </strong>time each other doing the same thing, but writing one letter on the 3rd row
                and then 1 number on the 4th row.</p>
            <p><strong>Round Up: </strong>Compare your results. Notice that task switching led to
                <ul>
                    <li>longer time</li>
                    <li>worse quality</li>
                    <li>increased stress</li>
                </ul>
                take your second sticky note, and plot it on the wall ranging from 30 seconds to 60 seconds</p>
